#This is my ReadMe File yay!

#I was curious as to the main purpose of a ReadMe file so I did some research to see what they can do / what professionals use them for. I found that they're mainly used for organizational purposes when constructing a project and you can add a table of contents, explain your project, etc. Its purpose is not to do the bulk of the coding.

#Next, I went into R Markdown to mess around in here.

# \#***Woohooo!***

#I also messed around and entered a [hyperlink](https://trello.com/b/nuQBHoIU/gwu-data-class-fall-2021) to see what that would look like when published on git (I tried to think of something fun to hyperlink and got nothing I'm sorry! so it just links to the class Trello page lol)

#Lastly, I'm going to insert a table into my ReadMe file to ensure that uploads properly as well.
