#This is my ReadMe File yay! 
#I was curious as to the main purpose of a ReadMe file so I did some research to see what they can do / what professionals use them for. I found that they're mainly used for organizational purposes when constructing a project and you can add a table of contents, explain your project, etc. Its purpose is not to do the bulk of the coding.
